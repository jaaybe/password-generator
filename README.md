[JB BLOT - PASSWORD GENERATOR](https://jaaybe.github.io/password-generator/)

## Description
I've created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
